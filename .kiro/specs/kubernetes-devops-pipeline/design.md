# Design Document

## Overview

This design provides a comprehensive DevOps pipeline solution for Kubernetes workloads using a monorepo architecture that emphasizes production readiness, security, and operational resilience. The solution includes multi-platform CI/CD implementations and battle-tested Kubernetes configurations that support cluster operations and multi-tenancy.

The design follows GitOps principles with clear separation of concerns between application code, infrastructure configuration, and deployment orchestration. The monorepo structure enables unified versioning, shared tooling, and atomic cross-service changes while maintaining security and reliability standards.

## Monorepo Implementation Strategy

### Core Benefits
- **Unified Versioning**: Single source of truth for all components with atomic releases
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Easier cross-service dependency management and updates

- **Shared Tooling**: Consistent build, test, and deployment tools across all services
- **Code Reuse**: Centralized shared libraries and utilities with version consistency

### Implementation Approach

#### Selective Build System
- **Change Detection**: Git-based detection of modified services and dependencies
- **Build Optimization**: Only build affected services and their dependents
- **Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching of unchanged components and dependencies
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent services build concurrently when possible

#### Dependency Management
- **Shared Libraries**: Centralized common code with semantic versioning
- **Configuration Management**: Shared configurations with service-specific overrides
- **Tool Standardization**: Consistent linting, testing, and build tools
- **Version Synchronization**: Coordinated updates across all services

#### Team Collaboration
- **Code Ownership**: Clear ownership boundaries using CODEOWNERS files
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches with service-specific prefixes
- **Review Process**: Automated routing to appropriate teams based on changed files
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive cross-service testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Scaling Considerations
- **Build Performance**: Implement incremental builds and distributed caching
- **Repository Size**: Use Git LFS for large assets and regular cleanup
- **Access Control**: Branch protection rules and path-based permissions
- **Team Autonomy**: Service-specific deployment pipelines within unified CI/CD
