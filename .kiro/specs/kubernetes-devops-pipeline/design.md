# Design Document

## Overview

This design provides a comprehensive DevOps pipeline solution for Kubernetes workloads that emphasizes production readiness, security, and operational resilience. The solution includes multi-platform CI/CD implementations, detailed repository strategy analysis, and battle-tested Kubernetes configurations that support cluster operations and multi-tenancy.

The design follows GitOps principles with clear separation of concerns between application code, infrastructure configuration, and deployment orchestration. It provides practical examples that teams can adapt to their specific needs while maintaining security and reliability standards.

## Repository Strategy Analysis

### Monorepo Advantages
- **Unified Versioning**: Single source of truth for all components
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Easier cross-service dependency management
- **Atomic Changes**: Cross-service changes in single commits
- **Shared Tooling**: Consistent build and deployment tools
- **Code Reuse**: Easier sharing of common libraries and utilities

### Monorepo Disadvantages
- **Build Complexity**: Longer build times as codebase grows
- **Access Control**: Difficult to restrict access to specific components
- **Scaling Issues**: Git performance degrades with repository size
- **Team Autonomy**: Reduced team independence and ownership
- **Technology Constraints**: Harder to use different tech stacks

### Multi-repo Advantages
- **Team Autonomy**: Independent development and deployment cycles
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different tech stacks per service
- **Access Control**: Granular repository-level permissions
- **Build Performance**: Faster, focused builds per repository
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one repo don't affect others

### Multi-repo Disadvantages
- **Dependency Management**: Complex cross-repository dependencies
- **Versioning Complexity**: Coordinating versions across repositories
- **Tooling Overhead**: Duplicated CI/CD configurations
- **Code Duplication**: Harder to share common code and libraries
- **Integration Testing**: Complex cross-service testing scenarios

### Decision Framework

#### Choose Monorepo When:
- Team size < 50 developers
- Tightly coupled services with frequent cross-service changes
- Homogeneous technology stack
- Strong emphasis on code sharing and consistency
- Centralized DevOps team managing all deployments

#### Choose Multi-repo When:
- Team size > 50 developers with multiple autonomous teams
- Loosely coupled services with independent release cycles
- Diverse technology stacks across services
- Strong team ownership and autonomy requirements
- Distributed DevOps responsibilities

#### Hybrid Approach:
- **Service Groups**: Related services in shared repositories
- **Platform Components**: Shared infrastructure in separate repositories
- **Application Boundaries**: Business domain-driven repository boundaries
- **Gradual Migration**: Start with monorepo, split as teams grow
