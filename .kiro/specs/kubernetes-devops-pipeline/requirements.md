# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a comprehensive DevOps pipeline example for building, testing, and deploying workloads on Kubernetes. It includes practical implementations across multiple CI/CD platforms, demonstrates best practices for container-based workflows, and provides detailed analysis of monorepo vs multi-repo strategies in Kubernetes environments. The solution aims to help teams choose the right repository strategy and implement production-ready pipelines that prioritize both speed and safety.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a complete pipeline example for Kubernetes deployments, so that I can implement proven workflows in my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer pushes code THEN the system SHALL trigger automated build processes
2. WHEN the build completes successfully THEN the system SHALL execute comprehensive test suites
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL build and push container images to a registry
4. WHEN images are available THEN the system SHALL deploy to Kubernetes clusters using GitOps principles
5. IF any step fails THEN the system SHALL halt the pipeline and provide clear error feedback
6. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL verify application health and readiness

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform team lead, I want examples for multiple CI/CD platforms, so that I can choose the best fit for my existing infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing pipeline options THEN the system SHALL provide GitHub Actions implementation
2. WHEN reviewing pipeline options THEN the system SHALL provide GitLab CI implementation  
3. WHEN comparing platforms THEN the system SHALL document platform-specific advantages and limitations
4. IF using different platforms THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent pipeline logic across implementations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an engineering manager, I want detailed analysis of monorepo vs multi-repo strategies, so that I can make informed architectural decisions for my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating repository strategies THEN the system SHALL document monorepo advantages and disadvantages
2. WHEN evaluating repository strategies THEN the system SHALL document multi-repo advantages and disadvantages
3. WHEN considering Kubernetes deployments THEN the system SHALL analyze impact on CI/CD pipeline complexity
4. WHEN considering team structure THEN the system SHALL analyze impact on development workflows
5. WHEN considering scaling THEN the system SHALL analyze impact on build times and resource usage
6. IF choosing a strategy THEN the system SHALL provide decision framework based on team size and project complexity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the pipeline to include security scanning and best practices, so that I can deploy applications safely to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building containers THEN the system SHALL scan images for vulnerabilities
2. WHEN deploying to Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL validate security policies and configurations
3. WHEN handling secrets THEN the system SHALL demonstrate secure secret management practices
4. WHEN accessing registries THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication and authorization
5. IF security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL block deployment and provide remediation guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pipeline to support different deployment environments, so that I can safely promote changes from development to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to development THEN the system SHALL use automated deployment triggers
2. WHEN deploying to staging THEN the system SHALL require successful development deployment
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL require manual approval gates
4. WHEN promoting between environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific configurations
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL support automated rollback capabilities
6. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL run environment-specific health checks
