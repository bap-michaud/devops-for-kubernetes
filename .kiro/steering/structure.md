# Project Structure

## Current Organization
The project is currently in its initial state with minimal structure:

```
.
├── README.md           # Project overview and documentation
├── LICENSE            # MIT License
└── .kiro/             # Kiro AI assistant configuration
    └── steering/      # AI guidance documents
```

## Expected Structure (As Project Grows)
Based on the DevOps for Kubernetes focus, the project will likely evolve to include:

```
.
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── pipelines/         # CI/CD pipeline configurations
│   ├── github-actions/
│   ├── gitlab-ci/
│   └── jenkins/
├── manifests/         # Kubernetes YAML manifests
│   ├── deployments/
│   ├── services/
│   └── configmaps/
├── helm-charts/       # Helm chart templates
├── scripts/           # Automation and utility scripts
├── docs/              # Additional documentation
└── examples/          # Example implementations
```

## Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for directories and files
- Kubernetes manifests should be descriptive (e.g., `web-app-deployment.yaml`)
- Pipeline files should indicate the platform (e.g., `.github/workflows/`)
- Scripts should have clear, action-oriented names

## Organization Principles
- Group related configurations together
- Separate by platform/tool when multiple options are provided
- Include examples and documentation alongside configurations
- Maintain clear separation between different deployment environments
