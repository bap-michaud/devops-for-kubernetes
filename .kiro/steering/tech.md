# Technology Stack

## Core Technologies
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform
- **YAML**: Configuration and manifest files
- **Docker**: Containerization (implied for Kubernetes workloads)

## DevOps Tools (Expected)
- CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
- Container registries
- Helm for package management
- kubectl for Kubernetes management

## File Formats
- YAML manifests for Kubernetes resources
- Dockerfiles for container builds
- Shell scripts for automation
- Markdown for documentation

## Common Commands
Since this is a DevOps pipeline project, common operations would include:

```bash
# Kubernetes operations
kubectl apply -f manifests/
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe deployment <name>
kubectl logs <pod-name>

# Docker operations
docker build -t <image-name> .
docker push <registry>/<image-name>

# Helm operations (if used)
helm install <release-name> <chart>
helm upgrade <release-name> <chart>
```

## Development Workflow
- Focus on production-ready, battle-tested solutions
- Emphasize safety and reliability in all pipeline configurations
- Prioritize clear documentation and examples
